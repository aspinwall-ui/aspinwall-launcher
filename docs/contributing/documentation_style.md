# Documentation style

This document describes the style rules used when writing documentation.

## Content

 * All documents must start with a short explaination of their contents, and usually include the words "This document describes...".
 * In most cases, **avoid using "we"**. If you're describing how something is done, provide instructions - use the imperative tense.
 * **Only use "you" when referring to something the user can/should do specifically**. In most cases, it can be replaced with instructions in the imperative tense.
   * Examples of when "you" can be used:
     * When recommending something to the reader (example: "You can also use `flake8` to automatically lint your code..." - [Coding style](coding_style.md))
     * In documents more broadly referring to the reader (example: the [Contributing](contributing.md) guide)

## Markdown syntax

 * Use the `#` symbol to prefix headers.
 * Lists use the `*` symbol, and are indented with one space.
   * For an example, see the raw version of this document.
 * Don't manually wrap lines.
