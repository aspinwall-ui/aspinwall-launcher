# Contributing to Aspinwall

Thank you for expressing interest in helping develop Aspinwall! This document describes some of the ways you can contribute to the project.

## Reporting issues

You can report issues you have experienced to [our bug tracker](https://github.com/aspinwall-ui/aspinwall/issues).

Please make sure to include the following in your bug report:

* The device you're running the shell on, and its CPU architecture
* The OS/distro you're using
* The version of Aspinwall you're running (you can check this by opening the menu in the launcher and selecting "About Aspinwall")
* If applicable, crash logs

## Fixing issues

Take a look at [our bug tracker](https://github.com/aspinwall-ui/aspinwall/issues). Issues marked with [good first issue](https://github.com/aspinwall-ui/aspinwall/labels/good%20first%20issue) are a good starting point.

## Contributing translations

We use [Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/aspinwall-ui/) to manage translations. Built-in widget translations are split to their own sub-components; the main shell and launcher translation can be found in the [Aspinwall Shell](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/aspinwall-ui/aspinwall-shell/) component.
